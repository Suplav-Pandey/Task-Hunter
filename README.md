# Task Hunter

## Description

Task Hunter is a hyperlocal platform designed to connect individuals seeking help for one-time, on-site tasks with local helpers ready to offer their services. Whether you need a hand with a quick repair, a garden cleanup, or any other single-instance job, Task Hunter helps you find reliable people in your area.

Users can register as either a "Task Poster" (client) or a "Helper" (freelancer). 

- **Helpers** can create a profile, list the services they offer, set their rates, and manage their availability. They have a dedicated dashboard to track their earnings and view testimonials from past clients.
- **Task Posters** can browse through a variety of local services, view helper profiles, and book someone for a specific task. They can manage their orders, track expenses, and communicate directly with helpers through an integrated chat system.

The platform aims to build a community of reliable local helpers and provide a simple, efficient way for people to get their tasks done.
